LaTeX is a powerful typesetting system. Although I've used it for many years, it is definetly a pain to use at times because of the nature of the language. In recent years, I have started to look for downstream solutions that would use Languages like Markdown or Org to replace the complexity of the LaTex, but ultimately use it as a backend when generating the PDFs.

* Portage Setup
** Package
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:conf: :tangle ~/.config/portage/sets/apps-latex :mkdirp yes :comments both
:END:

\(\LaTeX\) is typically installed via a texlive distribution. Portage provides one below.

#+begin_src conf
app-text/texlive
#+end_src

** USE Flags
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:conf: :tangle ~/.config/portage/package.use/apps-latex :mkdirp yes :comments both
:END:

#+begin_src conf
app-text/texlive graphics music science xetex
#+end_src
