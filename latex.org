LaTeX is a powerful typesetting system. Although I've used it for many years, it is definetly a pain to use at times because of the nature of the language. In recent years, I have started to look for downstream solutions that would use Languages like Markdown or Org to replace the complexity of the LaTex, but ultimately use it as a backend when generating the PDFs.
