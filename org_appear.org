* What is it?

=org-appear= provides a way to toggle various emphasis markers, links, subscripts, as the cursor appears over them. This helps keep the buffers very clean and tidy!

*An important thing to keep in mind about this package is that it does not support handling overlapping emphasis markers.*

#+begin_src org
*Why would someone /nest emphasis* like that?/
#+end_src

* Package Install
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle ~/.config/emacs/lisp/init-org-appear.el :comments both :mkdirp yes
:END:

Install the package and add the hook to [[file:org_mode.org][Org-mode]].  We must also make sure that =org-hide-emphasis-markers= is set to =t= /(otherwise, what is the point lol?)/

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package org-appear
  :after org
  :hook (org-mode . org-appear-mode)
  :custom
  ;; These will be unhidden by the org-appear package
  (org-hide-emphasis-markers t)
  (org-appear-autoentities nil)
  (org-appear-autolinks nil)
  (org-appear-autoemphasis t)
  (org-appear-autosubmarkers t))
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(provide 'init-org-appear)
#+end_src
