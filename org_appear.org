* What is it?

=org-appear= provides a way to toggle various emphasis markers, links, subscripts, as the cursor appears over them. This helps keep the buffers very clean and tidy!

*An important thing to keep in mind about this package is that it does not support handling overlapping emphasis markers.*

#+begin_src org
*Why would someone /nest emphasis* like that?/
#+end_src

* Package Install
