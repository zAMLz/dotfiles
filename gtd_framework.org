* What is GTD?

GTD is an acronym for "Getting Things Done". It is a framework for managing tasks and projects.

This document covers how I use GTD. We configure this framework for [[file:../config/org_mode.org][Org-mode]] which really just provides a barebones system for implementnig any task management system. So, what I've ended up doing is not exactly "GTD", but it is a variation that better suits my workflow.

* Configuration
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle ~/.config/emacs/lisp/init-gtd.el :comments both :mkdirp yes
:END:
** Setup Org

First let's make sure we pull in [[file:../config/org_mode.org][Org-mode]] as we build of it's provided system.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'init-org)
#+end_src

** Feature Provide

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(provide 'init-gtd)
#+end_src
