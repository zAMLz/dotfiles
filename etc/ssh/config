# Since we are using GPG agent as the SSH agent, when
# a terminal, ssh agent doesn't know that it has to
# change terminals (a bug in openssh). So when it
# connects to gpg-agent, it uses the terminal it
# was last configured to use. The following command
# when run in a terminal updates gpg-agent to use
# the current terminal for openssh. However, now
# if we run some ssh related command in the prior
# terminal, it will use the new terminal instead
# creating the exact inverse of the problem. Therefore
# we attempt to fix this by running this command
# before every SSH command.
