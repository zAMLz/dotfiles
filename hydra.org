/*Hydra & Hercules* by Unknown/

/Once you summon the Hydra through the prefixed binding (the body + any one head), all heads can be called in succession with only a short extension./

/The Hydra is vanquished once Hercules, any binding that isn't the Hydra's head, arrives. Note that Hercules, besides vanquishing the Hydra, will still serve his original purpose, calling his proper command. This makes the Hydra very seamless, it's like a minor mode that disables itself auto-magically./

=hydra= is simply a package that provides lets us create configurable menus for quick access to commands for [[file:emacs.org][GNU/Emacs]]

* Package Install
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle ~/.config/emacs/lisp/init-hydra.el :comments both :mkdirp yes
:END:

Load up the =hydra= package.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package hydra)
#+end_src

Here is a simple =hydra= function for scaling text.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defhydra hydra-text-scale (:timeout 4)
  "scale text"
  ("j" text-scale-increase "in")
  ("k" text-scale-decrease "out")
  ("f" nil "finished" :exit t))
#+end_src

We can add this =hydra= function to our [[file:general_el.org][General Leader Keybindings Definer]] for easy access.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'init-general)
(zamlz/leader-keys
  "ts" '(hydra-text-scale/body :which-key "scale text"))
#+end_src

Make sure to provide the module.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(provide 'init-hydra)
#+end_src
