* Diff-HL: Highlight Uncommited Changes

This package indicates which lines have been changed within [[file:emacs.org][GNU/Emacs]] buffers regardless of which version control system is used. Although, I only use [[file:git.org][Git]].

* Package Install
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle ~/.config/emacs/lisp/init-diff-hl.el :comments both :mkdirp yes
:END:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package diff-hl
  :init
  (global-diff-hl-mode)
  (global-diff-hl-show-hunk-mouse-mode)
  (diff-hl-flydiff-mode))
#+end_src

If we are using a version of [[file:magit.org][Magit]] that is greater than =2.4.0=, we need to also add the following hooks.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'magit-pre-refresh-hook 'diff-hl-magit-pre-refresh)
(add-hook 'magit-post-refresh-hook 'diff-hl-magit-post-refresh)
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(provide 'init-diff-hl)
#+end_src
