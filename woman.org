* Browse Unix Man Pages W.O. (without) Man
=WoMan= is a program that is an alternative to =Man= package that is typically installed on UNIX systems for reading manual pages. It certain situations, the package might not be present and =WoMan= is another similar interface for reading the manual pages.

* Configuration
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle ~/.config/emacs/lisp/init-woman.el :comments both :mkdirp yes
:END:

Depending on the system, you may want to change the values of =woman-manpath= and =woman-path=, but luckily for me, I don't have to do that.

I do wish to use the full frame's width instead of fixed width, so let's configure that (we can use =woman-fill-column= to specify a specific width if we wish).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq woman-fill-frame t)
#+end_src

Provide the feature

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(provide 'init-woman)
#+end_src
