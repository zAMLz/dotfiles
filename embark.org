* Minibuffer Actions Rooted in Keymaps
=embark= provides actions for minibuffer stuff.

* Configuration
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle ~/.config/emacs/lisp/init-embark.el :comments both :mkdirp yes
:END:
** Package Install

Time to setup the =embark= package.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package embark
  :disabled
  :bind (
  ;; Run the context menu for embark
  ("M-a"   . embark-act)
  ;; Run the context menu for embark but do not quit
  ("M-S-a" . zamlz/embark-act-noquit)
  ;; alternative for `describe-bindings'
  ("C-h B" . embark-bindings)))
#+end_src

** Embark-Act No Quit

This is a simple function that lets us run =embark-act= but not quit after running the corresponding action. For some reason this doesn't work as expected...

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun zamlz/embark-act-noquit ()
  "Run action but don't quit the minibuffer afterwards."
  (interactive)
  (let ((embark-quit-after-action nil))
    (embark-act)))
#+end_src

** Consult Integration

This also sets up [[file:consult.org][Consult]] integration for =embark=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package embark-consult
  :disabled
  :after (embark consult)
  :demand t ; only necessary if you have the hook below
  ;; if you want to have consult previews as you move around an
  ;; auto-updating embark collect buffer
  :hook
  (embark-collect-mode . consult-preview-at-point-mode))
#+end_src

** Which Key Integration

When running =embark-act=, let's make sure to use [[file:which_key.org][which-key]] so that we don't have to always remember which keys are available to us.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq embark-action-indicator
      (lambda (map _target)
        (which-key--show-keymap "Embark" map nil nil 'no-paging)
        #'which-key--hide-popup-ignore-command)
      embark-become-indicator embark-action-indicator)
#+end_src

** Feature Provide

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(provide 'init-embark)
#+end_src
