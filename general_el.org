=general.el= is a wrapper for the interface that lets users define keybindings for [[file:emacs.org][GNU/Emacs]].

* Package Install
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle ~/.config/emacs/lisp/init-general.el :comments both :mkdirp yes
:END:

Lets load up the =general.el= package here.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package general)
#+end_src

With this package, we create a function that is called =zamlz/leader-keys= that lets us quickly define personal keybindings to a global prefix.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(general-create-definer zamlz/leader-keys
  :keymaps '(normal insert visual emacs)
  :prefix "SPC"
  :global-prefix "M-SPC")
#+end_src

Add a couple of useful keybindings here for fun. I'll have to properly organize this later. This also showcases how to use the predefined function above. We also

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(zamlz/leader-keys
 "t"  '(:ignore t :which-key "toggles"))
#+end_src

Make sure to provide the package as well.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(provide 'init-general)
#+end_src
