* Automatic Table of Contents for Org Files
=org-make-toc= is a simple package for automatically generating table of contents buffers within [[file:org_mode.org][Org-mode]] files. This was very useful when I maintained large files, but now that everything is mostly split up, I seldom use it.

* Configuration

:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle ~/.config/emacs/lisp/init-org-make-toc.el :comments both :mkdirp yes
:END:
